## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 = 0.28 KHz | f1' = 0.24 KHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 1.4 MHz | f2' = 2.7 MHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 1.39 MHz ) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 2.6 MHz ) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 21 ) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 17.04 ) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 14.28 | G0' = 12.08 |

---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
